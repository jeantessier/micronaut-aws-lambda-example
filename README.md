# Micronaut-AWS Lambda Example

This example combines Micronaut with AWS Lambda, in Groovy.

I used the [Micronaut-Data documentation](https://guides.micronaut.io/latest/mn-application-aws-lambda-java-runtime-gradle-groovy.html)
as a starting point.

## To Test

    ./gradlew test

## To Run

You need to deploy the code to AWS Lambda in order to run it.

    ./gradlew shadowJar
